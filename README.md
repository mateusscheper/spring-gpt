# Spring GPT

## _Spring Boot application made entirely using ChatGPT_

---

This application was made entirely by prompting ChatGPT for its codes.
Every piece of code generated by ChatGPT was copied and pasted manually inside the project's directory, creating the
necessary files, importing and indenting the code accordingly.

## Prompts

The entire chat transcription is [here](./docs/chat-transcription.pdf) _(Please excuse my grammar mistakes)_.

## Running

Before starting the application, create a database in your PostgreSQL server named _springgpt_.
After that, simply open the project in your favorite IDE and run the application.

## Testing

To test the endpoints, import [this collection](./postman/spring-gpt.postman_collection.json) in Postman.
You can also run the endpoints using your IDE or simply running cURL in your terminal.
